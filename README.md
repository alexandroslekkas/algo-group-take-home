## 💻 Problems

### Option 1: Find Duplicate

- Code: `find-duplicate/option1.py`
- Tests: `find-duplicate/tests.py`
- Notes: `find-duplicate/option1Notes.txt`

This problem was solved with O(N) time and space complexity.

### Option 2: Implement Stack

- Code: `implement-stack/option2.py`
- Tests: `implement-stack/option2Tests.py`

I used OOP principles to build a system of nodes to emulate a stack.
